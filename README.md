Title: Molecular Biology Journey
Author: Zahra A.
Status: In Progress
Overview
This repository documents my self-directed journey in molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics.
It contains structured notes, summaries, and small analytical exercises aimed at building a strong foundation in modern molecular sciences.
Objectives
Strengthen theoretical understanding of genome structure, gene expression, and molecular mechanisms.
Develop practical skills in bioinformatics and computational analysis.
Build a consistent scientific portfolio demonstrating continuous learning and research engagement.
Prepare for future opportunities in laboratory work, research assistantships, or postgraduate study.
